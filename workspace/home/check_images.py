# DATE CREATED: 7/8/2023                                
# REVISED DATE: 
# PURPOSE: Classifies pet images using a pretrained CNN model, compares these
#          classifications to the true identity of the pets in the images, and
#          summarizes how well the CNN performed on the image classification task. 
#          Note that the true identity of the pet (or object) in the image is 
#          indicated by the filename of the image. Therefore, your program must
#          first extract the pet image label from the filename before
#          classifying the images using the pretrained CNN model. With this 
#          program we will be comparing the performance of 3 different CNN model
#          architectures to determine which provides the 'best' classification.
#
# Use argparse Expected Call with <> indicating expected user input:
#      python check_images.py --dir <directory with images> --arch <model>
#             --dogfile <file that contains dognames>
#   Example call:
#    python check_images.py --dir pet_images/ --arch vgg --dogfile dognames.txt

    # The function takes 3 command line arguments from the user:
    # - the path to the directory of pet images, as --dir (ex pet_images/)
    # - the name of model architecture to be used, as --arch (ex vgg)

    # The function get_pet_labels(...) is defined in the file get_pet_labels.py
    # The function takes the pet images directory. Using the filenames in the directory,

    # The function classify_images(...) is defined in the file classify_images.py
    # The function modifies the dictionary returned in the last function, adding to the values list
    # - (index 1) the label the classifier categorized the image as
    # - (index 2) the integer 1 if there is a match between the labels in indices 0 and 1, and 0 otherwise

    # This function creates the results statistics dictionary that contains a
